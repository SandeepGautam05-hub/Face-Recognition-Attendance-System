Face Recognition Attendance System

The Face Recognition Attendance System is a modern solution that uses computer vision to automate the process of marking attendance. Traditional methods like roll calls or manual registers are often slow, inaccurate, and vulnerable to proxy attendance. This project solves those issues by recognizing faces in real time and recording attendance securely.

Using a webcam or camera feed, the system detects faces, matches them against a list of registered users, and logs attendance with the exact date and time. The records are stored in a CSV file or database (SQLite/MySQL), making it easy to access, analyze, and export whenever needed.
